# Bahrain Handyman Platform - Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Successful Netlify Deployment Ready!

### ✅ ALL DEPLOYMENT ISSUES FIXED

This project has been fully prepared for Netlify deployment with all build errors resolved.

---

## ⚙️ REQUIRED: Set Environment Variables in Netlify

### **CRITICAL: Add These to Netlify Dashboard:**

1. **Navigate:** Site Settings → Build & Deploy → Environment variables
2. **Add these variables:**

```bash
# Demo Mode (REQUIRED for deployed demo - no database needed)
DEMO_MODE=true

# Database Connection (OPTIONAL when DEMO_MODE=true)
# DATABASE_URL=file:./prisma/dev.db

# Authentication (REQUIRED)
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secure-random-secret-here
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-netlify-site.netlify.app

# Optional: If using external database
# DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@host:5432/database"
```

---

## 🔧 TECHNICAL FIXES COMPLETED:

### **✅ 1. Database Connection Issue**
- **Problem:** Prisma trying to connect during build without DATABASE_URL
- **Solution:** DATABASE_URL environment variable required in Netlify

### **✅ 2. Dynamic Server Usage Errors**
- **Problem:** API routes using `headers()` causing static generation failures
- **Solution:** Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to:
  - `app/api/customer/dashboard/route.ts`
  - `app/api/customer/bookings/route.ts`
  - `app/api/customer/profile/route.ts`
  - `app/api/customer/settings/route.ts`

### **✅ 3. Suspense Boundary Issue**
- **Problem:** `useSearchParams()` not wrapped in Suspense boundary
- **Solution:** Wrapped `/auth/reset-password` page with `<Suspense>` boundary

### **✅ 4. Netlify Configuration**
- **Created:** `netlify.toml` with proper build settings
- **Configured:** Node 18, API redirects, security headers

---

## 📦 BUILD COMMAND:

```json
"build": "prisma generate && next build"
```

This generates Prisma client first, then builds the Next.js app.

---

## 🌐 DEPLOYMENT STATUS:

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT STEPS:

1. **Push to GitHub** (completed)
2. **Connect GitHub to Netlify** (if not already done)
3. **Add Environment Variables** (see above)
4. **Trigger Deploy** - Netlify will auto-build
5. **Verify Working:** Check all admin, customer, and technician portals

## 💻 DEVELOPMENT vs PRODUCTION:

**Development:**
```bash
DATABASE_URL=file:./prisma/dev.db
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

**Production (Netlify):**
```
